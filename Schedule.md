Schedule 1/10/2023

1/10 - 1/12
Finish getting familiar with github and hopefully finish most of the tasks in NClab


1/13 - 1/19
Start my Farkle project. Get the visuals how I want it. I.e. figure out placement of dice, background, and any text I want on the screen. I want to be able to see the dice on the screen and have it work with anywhere from one to six dice.

1/20 - 1/26
Start coding the dice to be random when I push a button. Still deciding on if it will be a button on the screen or the spacebar. Make a system for being able to remove the dice and score points. Make the program understand when the player has farkled.

1/27 - 2/2
Finish up the coding and logic. Test and fix any bugs that I find.

2/2 - finish project
