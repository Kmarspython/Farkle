1. Setup pygame environment for the dice to roll.
	- Decide width and height.
	- Create the game loop for the game to run in.
	- Get dice sprites loaded in.
2. Create the visuals for the dice rolling.
	- Decide how I want all six dice set up on the screen.
	- Decide how I want the dice set up when there dice taken out.
3. Use random to create the dice rolls.
	- Create a random number between one and six each time a button is pressed.
	- Assign each number to each dice sprite.
4. Create a button to roll the dice.
	- Make a system for removing dice to score points.
	- Make a system for rolling again after dice have been scored.
	- Make system for knowing if the the player has farkled.
	- Make system for keeping track of points.
